Recent new hardware and technology enable low-power inexpensive
distributed sensor networks. To realize certain applications such as
real time event detection, target tracking and system monitoring,
time synchronization is essential. In the literature, a book of time
synchronization techniques have been proposed. In general, the goal
of a time synchronization mechanism is to devise a scheme that
improves accuracy with lower energy consumption. Yet, there is
clearly a trade off between accuracy and energy consumption. It
would not be always desirable to deploy the most accurate time
synchronization as it might drain the power. The choice of a time
synchronization mechanism will depend on application's demand on
timing accuracy as well as the energy budget. To estimate
application's demand and select a proper time synchronization
mechanism, the relationship between application's performance or QoI
(Quality of Information) and time synchronization services are yet
to be investigated. This paper formalizes the relationship between
the performance of applications and time synchronization services
based on analytic frameworks using representative applications,
namely, event detection and estimation. The analysis shows the
impact of timing errors for different event duration, target moving
speed, number of sensors, sampling frequencies, etc. The analysis
framework can also be used to extract the maximum synchronization
errors that each application can sustain to achieve the desired QoI.

Moreover, time synchronization plays a key role in energy-saving
requirements. For example, accurate time synchronization can improve
the efficiency of duty-cycling and thus save energy. In this paper,
we will investigate the savings in power and bandwidth by employing
different stabilities of clock sources.
